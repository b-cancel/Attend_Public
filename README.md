# Attend_Public
<br>
The Attend App was created to make taking attendance easier for students and teachers.
<br>
I built it with 2 goals in mind.
<br>
1. Ensure that the student is in class
<br>
2. Ensure that the student can only log in themeselves
<br>
<br>
- The 1st is guaranteed by constantly shuffling a login code. This means that you can only plug in the code fast enough IF you are in the classroom.
<br>
- The 2nd is guaranteed by giving the device a permanent unique identifier.
